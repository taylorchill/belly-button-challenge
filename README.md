# belly-button-challenge
This project was designed to build a webage that showed my knowlede in creating 3 different charts. Those charts displayed data of bacteria found in the belly button.
Each sample had was identified by age, race, location, and b-type. To nagivate through each sample, I used the dropdown function to make data more accessbile.
